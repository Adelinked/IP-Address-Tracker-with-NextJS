## My process

### Built with

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework for production
- [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/) - To get the IP Address locations
- [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/)- To generate the map

### What I learned

From this challenge i learned how to use leaflet with ReactJS

### Continued development

I will do more projects that include mapping especially with leaflet because it allows for a lot of customization

### Useful resources

- [next-leaflet-starter](https://github.com/colbyfayock/next-leaflet-starter) - This helped me add leaflet map to my nextJs project in minutes.
